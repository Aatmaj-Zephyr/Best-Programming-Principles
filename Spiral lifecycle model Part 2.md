**In the last post, we studied about the spiral lifecycle model. Let us now continue discussing about the model in this part. Just in case you missed it, you can check it out [here](https://dev.to/aatmaj/spiral-lifecycle-model-part-1-4cjh)**

### Advantages of the model
The spiral lifecycle model helps you analyze risks and eliminate them before they get too big. One of the moist important advantages of the spiral model is that as the cost increases, the risk decreases. The more time and money you spend, the lesser risk you are actually taking, which is exactly what we all want in any lifecycle model.

The spiral model provides at least as much management control as the traditional waterfall model, you have the checkpoints ready just from the start of every iteration. Because the model is risk oriented, it provides you with the early indications of any risks possible. If in the worst case, the project cant be done for technical or any other reasons, you will find that out early on. Moreover the users can see the system easily from the start due to **effective prototyping**. This results in **Early user engagement**

The spiral lifecycle model can be coupled with other lifecycle models in a couple of different ways. This is why this model is very adaptable. And yes, the transition from building a project to maintaining it is so smooth that this boosts the overall maintainability of the project 

### Disadvantages
The only disadvantage of the spiral model is that it's a lot complicated.  It requires conscientious, attentive and knowledgeable management. It can be difficult to define objective, verifiable milestones that indicate weather you're ready to add the next layer to the model or not. In some cases, the product development is straight forward enough and project risks are modest enough that you don't need the flexibility and risk management provided by the spiral model. Not suitable for small or low risk projects and could be expensive for small projects.


### When to use this model
Use this model when you have an experienced management staff. Use in projects where user involvement is to be preferred over expected time to complete.

> Use For
##### For medium to high-risk projects.
##### When there is adequate to fair time.
