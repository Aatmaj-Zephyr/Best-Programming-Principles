# Principles of good software design
- Most programs spend their 90% time doing 10% instructions. Find this 10% and concentrate your efforts there.
- Never code until specifications are precise and complete. 
- Sometimes postponing (algorithmic) problems simplifies their solution, just like it happens in recursive algorithms.
- Choose the algorithm wisely according to the need. Unnecessary complication of algorithm doubles up the work. Dont choose a algorithm just because you know it. Keep your logic simple!
- Keep your algorithms as simple as you can. **When in doubt, choose the simple way**
- Consider time and space tradeoffs while deciding your algorithm.*(Valid in many conditions even to this date.)*
- Be sure that the algorithm is correct before starting to code. For this, make a throwaway prototype and test the algorithm. At least verify the intricate parts of the algorithm.
- If >40% code of a module gives errors, Rewrite the entire module again. Never be afraid to start over. Next time may be both shorter and easier than patchwork and bug-fixing. **Starting afresh is easier than patching an old program**
- **Act in haste and repent at leisure. Program in haste and debug forever!**
- Never optimize a program until it is correct and working.
- Don't optimize code unless absolutely necessary.
