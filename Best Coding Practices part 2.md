### Best coding practices to remember.

- Be sure to understand your problem before you decide how to solve it.

- Be sure you understand the algorithmic method before you start the program

- In case of difficulty, divide the problem into pieces and think of each part separately. (Divide and conquer)

- Keep your functions short and simple; rarely should a single function be more than a page long.

- Use techniques like "scaffolding" to simplify debugging. Scaffolding is a technique used to localize errors.

- Keep your programs well formatted as you write them. This makes debugging easier.

- Keep your documentation consistent with your code, and when reading a program make sure you debug he code and not just the comments.

- Explain your program to someone else: Doing so will help you understand it better yourself.
