# Principles of Extreme Programming XP
Xp is based on a set of proven practices that are all designed to work together, although many folks do pick and choose, and adopt only a portion of XP's rules

Here are a few practices.
- Make small, but frequent releases.
- Develop in iteration cycles and not in big-bang models
- Don't put anything that is not in the spec, no matter how tempted you to put in functionality for the future.
- Write the test code first
- No killer schedules, work regular hours
- Refactor (improve the code) whenever and wherever you notice the opportunity
- Don't release anything until it passes all tests
- Set realistic schedules, based around small releases.
- Keep it simple
- Program in pairs, and move people around so that everybody knows pretty much everything about code.
